                I&apos;m Thomas Miller, a senior software engineer working across platform engineering, cloud
                infrastructure, DevOps, site reliability, full-stack development, and application security.

                My work spans hands-on product development and the systems that keep products healthy: CI/CD,
                observability, identity and access management, incident response, scalable architecture, and clear
                technical documentation.
              </p>
              <p>
                I enjoy building extensible platforms such as <Link className="font-medium text-sky-500 hover:underline" href="/projects/eazyhq">EazyHQ</Link>, where product design, runtime architecture, and operations meet.
